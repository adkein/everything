    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Classical estimation just using the local information can be essentially useless if the sample size is small in the group. At the other extreme, a classical regression ignoring group indicators can be misleading in ignoring group-level variation. Multilevel modeling allows the estimation of group averages and group-level effects, compromising between the overly noisy within-group estimate and the oversimplified regression estimate that ignores group indicators.\n",

    "### Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio of variance/mean is thus a measure of dispersion, with var/mean = 1 indicating that the Poisson model is appropriate, and var/mean > 1 indicating overdispersion (and var/mean < 1 indicating underdispersion, but in practice this is much less common).\n",

    "### Hypothesis tests: multiple comparison procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "A concern is sometimes expressed that if you test a large number of hypotheses, then you’re bound to reject some. For example, with 100 different hypothesis tests, you would expect about 5 to be statistically significant at the 5% level—even if all the hypotheses were true. This concern is sometimes allayed by multiple comparisons procedures, which adjust significance levels to account for the multiplicity of tests."
