This is a story all about how my life got flipped/turned upside-down. I'd like to take a minute just
sit right there; I'll tell you everything there is to know about statistics and machine learning.

Everything

Not everything, actually. I'm setting out to document my own voyage through books and blogs, Jupyter
notebooks and GPUs, in a quest to learn ~everything~ some things (hopefully many) about the theory
and application of statistics and machine learning, all for posterity, or more likely just for my
own reference. I won't focus on any one particular domain of application, and in fact will probably
generate a lot of fake data for the sake of exploring various models and algorithms.
